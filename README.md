> A curated list of awesome things related to academic writing.

Writing is an important part of science. Even if many scientists are in the lab all day, they have to write down their results at the end. This collection contains the best tools for academic writing for people who love distraction free writing with (Pandoc) Markdown (and do not want to drown in LaTeX source code).

Most of the software, templates, and guides depend on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is the swiss army knife for document conversion. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is the one and only typesetting system.)
